# pyadd - Python Package Installation and Requirements Management Script
#
# This script automates the process of installing Python packages and updating
# the requirements.txt file. It performs the following tasks:
#
# 1. Validates that a package name was provided as an argument
# 2. Installs the specified package using pip
# 3. Verifies the installation was successful
# 4. Gets the installed version of the package
# 5. Updates requirements.txt by:
#    - Removing any existing entry for the package
#    - Adding the newly installed version
#
# Usage: pyadd <package_name>
# Example: pyadd requests
#
# The script will fail with an error message if:
# - No package name is provided
# - The pip installation fails
# - The installed version cannot be determined
#
# Note: requires pip and sed to be installed

# Check if package name is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then echo "Usage: pyadd <package_name>"; exit 1; fi

# Install the package using pip
pip install "$1"

# Check if pip install was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo "Failed to install $1"; exit 1; fi

# Get the installed version
VERSION=$(pip freeze | grep -i "^$1==")

# Check if version was found
if [ -z "$VERSION" ]; then echo "Could not find installed version of $1"; exit 1; fi

# Add/Update package in requirements.txt
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
    # Remove existing entry if present
    sed -i "/^$1==/d" requirements.txt
fi

# Append new version
echo "$VERSION" >> requirements.txt
echo "Added $VERSION to requirements.txt"
